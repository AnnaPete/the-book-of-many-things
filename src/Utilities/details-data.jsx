      "How to Play: generally, there are 3 steps. Step 1 - The DM describes the environment. Step 2 - The players describe what they want to do (sometimes this requires the player to roll a d20). Step 3 - The DM narrates the results of the players' actions, often using visual and/or auditory aids to help the players imagine the scene.", 

      "In Combat: The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other. On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Various class features, spells, and other abilities may let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. ", 

      "Outside of Combat: We're talking exploration and social interaction here. Exploring the space could mean spending an hour making your way through caverns underground, or simply opening a door or picking up a spellbook. Social interaction, if it isn't obvious, is basically just interacting with the people around you, such as interrogating a suspect or asking a random passerby for directions to the nearest tavern. The only limitations are the DM's permission and the players' imagination!",

      "Magic and Spells: In the worlds of D&D, people who practice magic are pretty rare, and thus are set apart from the general public. While evidence of magic is not uncommon, such as a fiendish monster, a wound visibly healing, or a wizard's familiar, actually seeing someone practice magic is highly unusual. For adventurers, however, magic is an essential tool to ensure their survival (not to mention the triumph over their enemies!)."
    ],

    races: ["While the worlds of D&D are endless in terms of possibility, there are still races (or humanoid species, if you will) that appear in every one. These are: humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, half-elves, half-orcs, gnomes, and tieflings. Each race is unique, and each one has perks that can prove to be very useful (i.e. elves have darkvision). When making your character, this is one of several factors to keep in mind if you want to maximize their potential in whatever class you want to play."],

    classes: ["Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talants they possess, and the tactics they are most likely to use in a particular situation. For example, My swashbuckler rogue elf helped apprehend an evildoer who stole a barrel of revival potions, and when no one was paying attention, she filled a flask full of it before handing the rest over to the owner. I was able to do it because I told my DM what I wanted to do, and I rolled very high on my slight-of-hand check (see skills)."],

    backgrounds: ["Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Backgrounds also provide concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, equipment, and languages)."],

    ability_scores: [
      " An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability.", 
      "A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20.", 
      "Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). Ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw."],

    skills: [" Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.", 
    "Strength: Athletics. Dexterity: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth. Intelligence: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion. Wisdom: Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival. Charisma: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion"],

    proficiencies: ["no additional information"],

    alignments: [
      "Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good." , 

      "Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.",

      "Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.",

      "Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.",
      "Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.",

      "Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.",

      "Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.",

      "Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths are neutral evil.",

      "Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or blood."],
